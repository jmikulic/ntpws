						<p>
							The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the
							tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
							weak
							through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
							children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who
							would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when
							I lay My vengeance upon thee.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a
							comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite
							of
							the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back
							when...
							You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt
							with my
							name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
							sitting
							outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's
							what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here
							shopping for an infant named Jeb.
